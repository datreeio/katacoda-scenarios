# step 2

Within each step, a series of Markdown extensions have been created that can provide various details for the users' experience.

For example, commands such as `echo "Run in Terminal"`{{execute}}
 can be executed by clicking the command.

This is done by adding `execute` to the markdown code block, for example:
`echo "Run in Terminal"`{{execute}}
